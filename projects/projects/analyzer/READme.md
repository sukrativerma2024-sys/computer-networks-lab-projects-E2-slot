# Network Congestion Visualization Lab

An interactive web-based simulation platform for understanding network congestion, TCP/UDP protocols, and network traffic behavior through real-time visualizations.

## Features

- **Traffic Flow Simulation**: Visualize network packets as vehicles on a highway
- **Network Packet Simulation**: Real-time packet flow through network infrastructure
- **Protocol Behavior Analysis**: Compare TCP vs UDP performance in various conditions
- **Performance Analytics**: Live charts and metrics for throughput, packet loss, and efficiency
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust packet rates, network capacity, and protocols in real-time

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Modern CSS features (gradients, animations, variables)
